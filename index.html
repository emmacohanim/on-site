                <small id="small1">I was born and raised in Seattle, WA and moved back to the area after graduating from Tulane University in 2020. My introduction to coding was an accidental one and occurred through the computer game Marbleblast Gold. I had completed all of the game's levels and wanted to create my own, so I turned to YouTube tutorials. The tutorials showed me how to modify the game's existing levels as well as build my own using code. I followed the instructions and was elated when the levels transformed right before my eyes. The funny thing is that at the time, I had no idea what coding was. All I knew was that the process made sense to me, and I felt pride seeing the changes I had made to the game. Fifteen years later, I found my way back to coding through Flatiron School's immersive software engineering course. I am beyond excited to dive deeper into the world of coding and to take the skills gained from my software course to a career in tech.</small>
